# Starter Project

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wGviX-kwstI?si=v7bMy-6ZhwkNnDPd" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

I made a basic, calculator for my starter project. This was mainly used for practice with soldering and other basic skills. The calculator itself has the four basic functions and a clear button. During the process, I ended up not using the provided socket and decided to solder the IC in directly, in order to save time as well as give the calculator a sleeker profile. This project succeeded in teaching the basics of soldering and electrical components, and was good preparation for the tasks ahead.

When pressed, the buttons on the circuit board allow the the flow of electricity through resistors, transistors and other components into an integrated circuit, which detects the newfound change in voltage. The IC then runs the input through a series of logic computations in order to compute the intended output, which is then displayed on an LCD screen.

The challenge of this project was the precision required when soldering the components. Some of the pins were very close together, and I would accidentally solder them together, creating a short circuit. Thankfully, I was able to remove the excess solder, and this issue was soon resolved.

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
